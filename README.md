Convolutional Neural Network to classify Images of Cats and Dogs :

Image classification of cats and dogs is a common computer vision task that involves training a machine learning model to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. Here are the general steps involved in building an image classifier for cats and dogs:

Data collection: Collect a large dataset of cat and dog images from various sources, such as the ImageNet dataset, Kaggle, or Google Images.

Data preprocessing: Preprocess the images by resizing them to a fixed size (e.g., 224x224), normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Model selection: Choose a suitable deep learning model for image classification, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a type of neural network designed to process and classify images.

Model training: Train the selected model on the training dataset using an appropriate optimization algorithm and loss function.

Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the validation dataset to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, to improve its performance on the validation dataset.

Model testing: Test the final model on the test dataset to measure its performance on unseen data.
